      "content": "Great question! Spirit II is the evolution of the original Spirit collection. The primary difference between the two collections lies in their thematic inspiration and fragrance profiles. Spirit I is built around the themes of Hope, Confidence, and Love, offering moods that are fresh, romantic, and elegant through main notes of green leaves, florals, and wood. In contrast, Spirit II focuses on the themes of Passion, Dream, and Life, providing scents that evoke a bright, warm, and nostalgic feeling using notes like amber, red berries, and incense. While both sets share the same functional benefits, such as a compact design and skin-safe glitter for a shimmering glow, they cater to different emotional atmospheres."
