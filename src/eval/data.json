As it settles, the heart reveals a soft floral bouquet with pansy, magnolia, cattleya orchid, and muguet—like walking through a blooming garden. Finally, it finishes with warm, comforting base notes of peach, amber, musk, and cedar that stay close to your skin. It's fresh at first, elegant in the middle, and cozy all day long!"
