- **Passion** – Energy, warmth, and joyful vibrancy  
- **Dream** – Sophistication, elegance, and aspiration  
- **Life** – Positivity, wisdom, and vitality  

Together, they offer a complete scent journey, encouraging users to wear, layer, or switch fragrances depending on how they feel or where they are going.
